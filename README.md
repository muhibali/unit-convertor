## About

Made by Muhib Ali. Aspiring Software Engineer. Attending McMaster University for Software Engineering and Management Co-op, currently in his second-year of university. Learning full-stack and creating 3 full-stack apps.

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to convert common units with user input. 

The program's base functions so far prompt the user to give a numeric value that they wish to convert into any of the following: metres, feet, litres, gallons, kilos, pounds. The program does not worry about exception handling just yet as it is in its beginning stages of development. In the future, this project will be improved by implementing exception handling for if the user chooses to send in a non-numerical value.

This project was created with the help of Scrimba's Fullstack Path that Muhib Ali is enrolled in.
